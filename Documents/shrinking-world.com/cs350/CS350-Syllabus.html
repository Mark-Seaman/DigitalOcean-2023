<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>Grades will be based on 7 project Milestones</p>
<p><strong>Scale:</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>80.00%+ = B</li>
<li>70.00%+ = C</li>
<li>60.00%+ = D</li>
<li>below 60% = F</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Class Engagement:</strong> Each class session will be
delivered by notes, slides, documents, and recorded tutorial videos. The
class sessions will be used to help students complete the project work.
These will be public help sessions where technical problems will be
solved while other students can watch and learn. Private help sessions
can also be scheduled for individual mentoring. Projects will be due
each week. There will not be any exams. All projects must be completed
by the last day of class.</p>
<p><strong>Attendance and Participation:</strong></p>

<li>You are expected to work through all of the published content on
your own.</li>
<li>Readings and interactive exercises are assigned daily but are not
part of your total grade.</li>
<li>Demo code will be provided to help you complete each project.</li>
<li>Each student will be required to meet weekly with their project team
for collaboration. Other team members will evaluate your participation
in team activity.</li>
<li>Each student will be required to meet bi-weekly with the instructor
for a sprint planning session. Students will show off the work completed
and get customer feedback that will be incorporated into the next
sprint.</li>

<h2 id="mcb-statement-on-using-generative-ai">MCB Statement on Using
Generative AI</h2>
<p>Generative AIi tools can be good resources for enhancing teaching and
learning. These tools also have limitations and can hinder learning if
not used appropriately. It is imperative that we all understand the
opportunities, problems, and ethical issues associated with the use of
generative AI tools.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be aware of risks to privacy and intellectual property.</li>
<li>Be aware that AI-generated content may contain biases.</li>
<li>Be aware that AI-generated content may contain incorrect and
outdated information.</li>
<li>Be aware that some forms of AI use constitute plagiarism or
copyright infringement. You cannot submit AI- generated content as your
own work.</li>
</ul>
<p>At Monfort College of Business, our mission is to prepare you to
become successful leaders. We strive to be innovative in our teaching to
enhance your learning. Incorporating AI as a learning tool has benefits.
If it is used inappropriately, however, it is considered academic
dishonesty. For example, submitting work prepared by someone else,
including AI, and claiming the work is your own is dishonest. As noted
in the MCB Student Code of Professional Conduct, academic dishonesty can
result in disciplinary action. Potential disciplinary actions include
the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A failing grade for an assignment</li>
<li>A failing grade for a class</li>
<li>Suspension from MCB</li>
<li>Expulsion from MCB</li>
</ul>
<p>Each class at MCB has different rules and requirements for using
generative AI tools, and it is your responsibility to follow the
guidelines in the syllabus of each class. Ask your professor if you have
any questions about the policies in the syllabus. Please note that
AI-related plagiarism detection tools are available to us now. Remember
to use all available resources appropriately to enhance your learning.
You are expected to submit your own work.</p>

machine learning algorithms to create new and original content like

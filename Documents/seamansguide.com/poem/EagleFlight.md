# Flight of the Eagle

Oh, the places you'll go,
If you follow your heart and let your dreams flow,
You'll see sights you never knew existed,
And make memories that will never be twisted.

You'll climb mountains high and valleys low,
And swim in oceans where the water glows,
You'll meet creatures great and small,
And learn things that will astound you all.

You'll taste foods that will make your taste buds dance,
And hear music that will make your heart prance,
You'll smell flowers that are sweet as can be,
And touch things that are as soft as a baby's knee.

So go out there and explore,
Let your spirit soar,
There's a whole world out there waiting for you,
Just be brave and see what you can do.

And when you're tired and ready to rest,
Just remember that you did your best,
You saw things that many never see,
And made memories that will forever be.

So go out there and make your mark,
And when it's over, know that you left a spark,
Of joy and wonder that will live on,
In the hearts of those whose lives you shone.

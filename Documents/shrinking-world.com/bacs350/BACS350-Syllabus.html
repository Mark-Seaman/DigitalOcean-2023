<p><em>NOTE: Topics will be adjusted to match the progress of the
class.</em></p>
<h2 id="class-engagement">Class Engagement</h2>
<p>Each class session will be delivered by notes, slides, documents, and
recorded tutorial videos. The class sessions will be used to help
students complete the project work. These will be public help sessions
where technical problems will be solved while other students can watch
and learn. Private help sessions can also be scheduled for individual
mentoring.</p>
<p>Projects will be due each week. There will not be any exams. All
projects must be completed by the last day of class.</p>
<h2 id="attendance-and-participation">Attendance and Participation:</h2>
<ul>
<li>You are expected to work through all of the published content on
your own and show up for the student help session when you need to.</li>
<li>Readings and interactive exercises are assigned daily and are a
major component of your total grade.</li>
<li>Demo code will be provided to</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcb-statement-on-using-generative-ai">MCB Statement on Using
Generative AI</h2>
<p>Generative AIi tools can be good resources for enhancing teaching and
learning. These tools also have limitations and can hinder learning if
not used appropriately. It is imperative that we all understand the
opportunities, problems, and ethical issues associated with the use of
generative AI tools.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be aware of risks to privacy and intellectual property.</li>
<li>Be aware that AI-generated content may contain biases.</li>
<li>Be aware that AI-generated content may contain incorrect and
outdated information.</li>
<li>Be aware that some forms of AI use constitute plagiarism or
copyright infringement. You cannot submit AI- generated content as your
own work.</li>
</ul>
<p>At Monfort College of Business, our mission is to prepare you to
become successful leaders. We strive to be innovative in our teaching to
enhance your learning. Incorporating AI as a learning tool has benefits.
If it is used inappropriately, however, it is considered academic
dishonesty. For example, submitting work prepared by someone else,
including AI, and claiming the work is your own is dishonest. As noted
in the MCB Student Code of Professional Conduct, academic dishonesty can
result in disciplinary action. Potential disciplinary actions include
the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A failing grade for an assignment</li>
<li>A failing grade for a class</li>
<li>Suspension from MCB</li>
<li>Expulsion from MCB</li>
</ul>
<p>Each class at MCB has different rules and requirements for using
generative AI tools, and it is your responsibility to follow the
guidelines in the syllabus of each class. Ask your professor if you have
any questions about the policies in the syllabus. Please note that
AI-related plagiarism detection tools are available to us now. Remember
to use all available resources appropriately to enhance your learning.
You are expected to submit your own work. i “Generative Al is a type of
artificial intelligence (AI) that uses machine learning algorithms to
create new and original content like images, videos, text, and audio
based on user-defined prompts by utilizing algorithms to recognize
patterns in input data”</p>

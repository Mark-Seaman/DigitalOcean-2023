# Course Prep with AI

Today I woke up with the idea of using AI to create course plans. I know a lot of people who are actively building curricula for different areas of study. There are many teachers in my realm of contacts.

Within a few minutes, I created an outline for a short course to teach Japanese to high school students. The next course plan I made was for a short class on Genetics. Then I turned to Spiritual Formation and finally I built a class on Creating an Online Teaching Business.

Within an hour I had a very good first cut at building course content for four different areas spanning a broad range of topics. This was all accomplished by issuing prompts into chatGPT to create the content. The raw output needed a small amount of minor editing to be closer to my ideal course plan.

It takes roughly 15 minutes to produce an actionable course plan for a subject of interest. The main trick is knowing how to coax chatGPT into producing the desired output. I've included the prompts that I used and the final output that was generated.

Get started with chatGPT to try it out for yourself at https://chat.openai.com. Its free, but you may want to get faster access for $20/month.

Check out the following case studies. Keep in mind that this was done in a few minutes.

* Japanese for High School Students
* Genetics 101
* Spiritual Formation
* Online Teaching Business

# A Yard Full of Birds

by Mark Seaman

---

In your back yard, what do you see?
An eagle, a heron, a pelican, and a cormorant, let me see.

The eagle is proud, with feathers so grand,
His sharp talons and keen eyesight are just in demand.

The heron is tall, with a neck long and thin,
He wades through the water with a graceful spin.

The pelican is funny, with a beak like a scoop,
He dives for fish and always brings home the soup.

The cormorant is sleek, with feathers dark and smooth,
He dives deep and catches fish with his groove.

Each bird is unique, with its own special flair,
They're all different, but they all have a care.

For the water they share, and the land they call home,
They live in harmony, and they never do roam.

They perch on branches and take to the sky,
And always watch out with a sharp eagle eye.

In your back yard, these birds will be found,
And they'll always be there, with their wings spread around.

So cherish these creatures, both great and small,
And always remember, they make our world whole.
